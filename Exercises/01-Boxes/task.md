# Drawing Boxes


Write a small programm to draw a box in the terminal like this:


```
+-------------------+
|                   |
|                   |
|                   |
|                   |
+-------------------+
```

The height and width of the box should be configurable by the user.


_Hint_: The print() function accepts additional arguments.

```python

# This will print without a newline 
#  and instead adds the string 'END'
#  to the end of the line
print("text a", end="END")  

# This will print the strings and use
# "+" as a separator between "a", "b"
# and 23
print("a", "b", 23, sep="+") 
```
